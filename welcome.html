<p style="border-bottom:2px solid gold;">Welcome to <i>feeder</i></p>
<p>Posts from feeds you've subscribed to are shown here.
And system messages, like this one.
Click the sprocket-icon on the top-right to list your current subscriptions or to add subscriptions.
If you have an OPML file, select OPML and then import to add its feeds to your subscriptions.
It may take a while for new feeds for posts to get loaded by the background process that processes feeds.
</p>
<p>Click on a post's title to view the item's description.
Use the down arrow to load the post's URL into the i-frame (this doesn't work with all websites).
Use the right arrow to open the post's URL into a new window or tab.
Use the cross to close the post view.</p>
<p>Viewing posts marks them as read.
When scrolling down, post titles moving out of view are marked as read.
When marking posts as read (and when the server responds), the new total of unread posts is updated top-right.
</p>
<p>If you notice something out of the ordinary, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/stijnsanders/feeder/issues">post an issue</a>.<br />

<p>Enjoy!</p>
